The emotions hit me in waves – some days I feel okay, other days I'm overwhelmed with sadness and anxiety.\n\nIf you've been through something similar, what practical things helped you start healing? Did therapy, support groups, journaling, new hobbies, exercise, travel, or anything else make a big difference? How did you handle the urge to check up on your ex or relive old memories?\n\nAny tips, resources, or personal stories about what actually worked for you would mean a lot. I want to focus on healthy coping strategies and avoid falling into bad habits.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read and share your experiences!.",
